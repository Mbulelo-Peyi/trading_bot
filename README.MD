Sure! Here’s a professional and clear **README.md** template for your trading bot project using FastAPI and Alpaca API:

# Trading Bot API

A FastAPI-based trading bot integrating with the Alpaca API for paper trading and automated trade execution using a transformer model for prediction.

---

## Features

- Retrieve blotter (trade history)
- Get account information and current positions
- Cancel all open orders
- Automated prediction and trading based on a transformer model
- Manual trade execution via POST requests
- Built with FastAPI for asynchronous, fast HTTP API handling
- Tested with pytest and AsyncClient for reliability

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [Alpaca API](https://alpaca.markets/) account (paper trading enabled)
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file or set environment variables for Alpaca API credentials:

```env
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_api_key
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
ALPACA_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets
```

---

## Running the Bot

Start the FastAPI server locally:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

---

## API Endpoints

### GET

* `/blotter`
  Returns trade blotter data from the Alpaca account.

* `/account`
  Retrieves account information.

* `/positions`
  Lists current open positions.

* `/cancel_orders`
  Cancels all open orders.

* `/predict_and_trade`
  Runs prediction on the blotter and executes trades automatically based on model output.

### POST

* `/trade`
  Manually place a trade.
  **Request Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "qty": 1,
    "side": "buy",
    "type": "market",
    "limit_price": null
  }
  ```

  `limit_price` is required for limit orders.

## Testing

Run tests using pytest:

```bash
pytest -v
```

## Notes

* The transformer model is pre-trained and adapted on startup with sample trade instructions.
* The bot currently uses Alpaca’s paper trading environment.
* Ensure your API keys have the necessary permissions for trading.

## Model Performance

The trading bot's sentiment analysis model achieved **90% accuracy** on a Kaggle dataset, demonstrating strong predictive capability in classifying trade signals.
